          Behind every great company, leader, CEO, Artist, or Creator, is an inspiring journey comprised of moments of
          trials, triumphs and tribulations. I remember early on in my career looking for the coolest people I could
          find brought me to linkedin which showed everyone as a timeline of glorified status symbols- misdirecting my
          ambitious pursuits. What if instead of Harvard degrees and FANG internships, the world saw the process/
          journey of the a person?

          Imagine a world where 17-year-old Elon Musk documented his journey and the moments he shared with the world
          throughout his life. The second order impact of curated processes will be huge, and early collectors/ people
          tagged in Elon's Judiciarys would be greatly rewarded.
